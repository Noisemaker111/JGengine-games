# Published-package game integration

PRs #2 (Studio hazard health) and #3 (Robots chest/vignette) are integrated on
current main. PR #1 stays separate: its facade material objects require the
engine change in [jgengine #1749](https://github.com/Noisemaker111/jgengine/pull/1749).
That change is merged upstream but is absent from installed published core 0.18.1,
whose building palette values are strings. No facade API casts or source aliases
are used here, and #1's head is not part of this integration's ancestry.

## Reproducible setup

Run `bun install --frozen-lockfile` from the repository root. The lock installs
published core/react/shell/assets 0.18.1 and pins editor 0.18.0: editor 0.18.1
requires unpublished navbake. The declared TypeScript native-preview development
dependency supplies the games' existing `tsgo` scripts.

From each game directory, provision its catalog packs using
`bun node_modules/@jgengine/assets/dist/cli/pull.js pull <source> --dir public`.
Do not reindex the installed package or commit downloaded models/materials.

| Game | Sources |
| --- | --- |
| Loopline | kaykit-city-builder, quaternius-stylized-nature, kaykit-adventurers, ambientcg-grass001 |
| The Robots | quaternius-modular-scifi, quaternius-stylized-nature, kaykit-adventurers, kaykit-space-base, ambientcg-ground025, ambientcg-rock022, ambientcg-metal007, ambientcg-metalplates001 |

Run `bun run check-types`, `bun run test`, and `bun run vite build` from each
target game's directory. No build command deploys. Vite and Tailwind resolve
published packages, including their CSS classes; the missing monorepo dev-save
plugin is no longer imported. Robots asset checks inspect its own `public` root.

## Observed verification

Windows, Bun 1.3.14, Node 24.18, published packages only:

| Game | Tests | Typecheck | Vite build |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| Loopline | 25 / 25 | pass | pass |
| Studio Showcase | 15 / 15 | pass | pass |
| The Robots | 88 / 88 | pass | pass |

The Studio test drives the real authored trigger and game loop using the published
headless runner: health 100 → 82 inside, 82 → 90 outside, then death → full health
at authored spawn. Robots command tests verify both chest types pay once; hurt
signal tests verify health decreases trigger feedback, while initial reads/heals
do not. Builds retain normal large-chunk warnings.

Owned headless Chrome sessions opened each game's existing standalone GameHost
on separate ports. All rendered without JavaScript exceptions. Loopline's live
simulation populated guests and shops, and clicking the ticket control changed
$18 to $19. Robots character selection entered play; firing reduced the magazine
from 16 to 14 while reserve stayed 80.
Both reported no model fallback or texture-error diagnostics. These browser checks
also exposed and verified the fix for missing published Tailwind classes, which
had collapsed the canvas to about 150px high.

## Limits

Browser hazard entry/drain/regen and chest/vignette visuals were not reproduced
in these sessions. The legacy `--spawn` URL overlay is installed by the engine
dev runner, not standalone GameHost; passing that URL did not position these
sessions and is not accepted gameplay evidence. Headless rules tests do not prove
those visuals. Studio's existing player proxy and terrain/render warnings remain.
No performance claim is made from the headless rendering samples.

Editor save/reload persistence, other games' existing type failures, and the
unpublished facade API remain outside this verified source result. No installed
game or shared service was changed; no package was published or production
deployment performed.
